description: This GitHub Action validates that the major label is only assigned to Pull Requests targeting the default branch, enhancing the management of significant changes.

introduction: |-
  This is a GitHub Action to validate that only Pull Requests targeting the default branch can have the `major` label set. This is useful in combination with the [`release-drafter`](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) and the Cloud Posse [`release-branch-manager`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-release-branch-manager) GitHub Actions,  to ensure the `major` label can only be assigned to Pull Requests created against the default branch, ensuring that significant changes are clearly identified and properly managed.

usage: |-
  ```yaml
    name: validate-release-labels

    on:
      pull_request:
        types:
          - labeled
          - unlabeled
          - opened
          - synchronize
          - reopened

    jobs:
      validate:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: cloudposse/github-action-release-label-validator@v1
